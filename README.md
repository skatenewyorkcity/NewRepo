# SimpleWebApp README
Okay, lets create a simple web application with use of the following...

## Tools
Bootstrap(Themes), HTML, CSS, Javascript, LightBox
Node.js(Javascript Server-side Runtime Enviroment), NPM(Package Management) {Morgan + Nodemon}
Express(Web Server), MySql(DB), Sequelize(ORM)
Mocha, Chai, Sinon

for our efforts we'll use...

### "Agile" as our software development approach
By outlinning our Features, Spike User Stories, Enabler User Stories and User Stories throughout our PI (Project Increment).
Note - It is important that Dependencies with other teams be identified in our planning process, since this app is simple we are the only team. Additionally keep in mind that an "Epic" has "Features" and can span accross various PIs, A "Feature" is implemented/delivered within its respective PI timeframe and finally, a PI has five "Sprints" which contain the "Features" and their respective child items (Spikes, User Story, Non-Deliverables etc).

Epic: Create person app
```
Feature - Setup/configure or stack/infrastructure
  Spike User Story - Design/deploy our local stack
  Enabler User Story - Install NPM, install nodemon
  Enabler User Story - Install morgan, install express
  Enabler User Story - Setup git repository
  User Story - Implement simple "Hello World" page
```
```
Feature - Implementation of web application front-end
  Spike User Story - Design the page objects styling and navigation
  Enabler User Story - Install Bootcamp
  User Story - Create and style pages
  User Story - Implement/configure header menu buttons navigation logic/routing
```
```
Feature - Implementation of CRUD operations
  Spike User Story - Research CRUD implementation approach in Express, NodeJs and JSON
  User Story - Implement GET
  User Story - Implement POST
  User Story - Implement Confirmation/alerts with Lightbox
  User Story - Implement PUT
  User Story - Implement DELETE
```
```
Feature - Implementation of CRUD operations by MySql DB
  Spike User Story - MySql ERD model design, perform normalization if necessary
  Spike User Story - Research Heroku setup/deployments
  Enabler User Story - Setup Heroku
  Enabler User Story - Setup MySql DB
  User Story - Implement SELECT query
  User Story - Implement INSERT query
  User Story - Implement PUT query
  User Story - Implement DELETE query
  User Story - Deploy MySql DB
```
```
Feature - Pivot CRUD operations from MySql to Sequelize ORM
  Spike User Story - Research Sequelize implementation process
  User Story - Translate SELECT query into Sequelize ORM implementation
  User Story - Translate INSERT query into Sequelize ORM implementation
  User Story - Translate UPDATE query into Sequelize ORM implementation
  User Story - Translate DELETE query into Sequelize ORM implementation
```
Moving along lets begin...

### Planning our Sprints
To secure short term delivery by taking into consideration Sprint capacity and load. Sprints on average last one to two weeks. For this app, we'll be winging it (2-3 day Sprints?).
```
Sprint 1
```
```
Sprint 2
```
```
Sprint 3
```
```
Sprint 4
```
```
Sprint 5
```
...more on the way.
